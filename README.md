# Online Resume
Hi! My name is Ahmed Khan. I am building this online resume to showcase my experiences, projects and skills. The information on this website is similar to what I have on LinkedIn. However, I have more control on how to display data. I am using the following technical components:

* HTML 
* JavaScript
* CSS
* JSON
* draw.io (for desiging the architecture diagrams). 

This website is still work in progress. 

Overall it is a static website. However, all the data such as employment history, education history, the projects I have worked on throughout my career, and more; are all stored in JSON files. The JavaScript code retrieves the data and renders on the webpage.

I am designing this online resume in a framework so others can also reuse the code. All the content is stored on github.io i.e., free web hosting service for static web content.

Hope you like this website. Feel free to provide your feedback. Thank you!
