# Online Resume
Hi! My name is Ahmed Khan. I am building this online resume using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and JSON. This is still work in progress. 

Overall it is a static website. However, all the data such as employment history, education history, the projects I have worked on throughout my career, and more; are all stored in JSON files. The JavaScript code retrieves the data and renders on the webpage.

I am designing this online resume in a framework so others can also reuse the code. All the content is stored on github.io i.e., free web hosting service for static web content.

Hope you like this and feel free to provide your feedback. Thank you!
